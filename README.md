# IT Service Desk Ticketing System Simulation

This project simulates a real-world IT Service Desk workflow using a mock ITSM tool (Spiceworks/Jira Service Desk/GLPI).  
It demonstrates incident management, SLA tracking, escalation, and a structured knowledge base.

## Features
- Incident categorization (Hardware, Software, Network, Accounts)
- SLA definitions for response/resolution times
- Escalation process (L1 → L2 → Vendor)
- Knowledge base for first-call resolution

## Repository Contents
- `workflow/`: Ticket lifecycle and escalation diagrams
- `knowledge-base/`: Markdown guides for common issues
- `demo/`: Screenshots of the mock ticketing system
